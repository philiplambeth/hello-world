Just re-familiarizing 

My name is Philip Lambeth and I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California - San Francisco in the laboratory of Dr. Elyssa Margolis.
We work on a brain region critically involved in drug reward and pain sensation known as the VTA, and are particularly interested in the endogenous opioids, their receptors, and how alcohol and other drugs of abuse engage these systems in the brain.
